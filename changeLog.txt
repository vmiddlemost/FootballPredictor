- Built core of the program and just calculated the average score difference and standard deviation for all oppositional teams to Arsenal in the premier league

- Found a normal distribution package online to use to give my code percentage chances of a win, loss and draw
- Calculate win as having more than 0.5 goals difference, a draw with being between -0.5 and 0.5 goals difference and a loss being below -0.5 goals difference
- Found weird edge cases like away games at Watford being calculated at a 100% win rate, despite both previous head to heads having a goal difference of just 1

- Discovered the Watford edge case to be because both games were won by just one goal, both the game's distance to the mean and the overrall mean are 1, making 
the standard deviation 0 for both games (as this is how standard deviation is calculated)
- Not entirely sure how to fix this issue, so I've added in an if statement to help with this edge case (if standard deviation == 0, standard deviation = 0.8)
- Found another weird case where due to Arsenal having really good past results against Newcastle at home, they're being calculated to have a 100% win rate for
that fixture. This won't do, so to help combat the problem for the time being I've doubled the standard deviation for all games

- To give the percentages more realism, I've added a draw percentage method which takes from a list of premier league teams' average chance to draw a game
over the past season and a half and added that into the overall formula (Arsenal rarely draw games so the calculations now reflect this more)
